		<h3>I am a Jasper V. Holgado. A BSIT student from Polytechnic University of the Philippines
		at Santa Maria, Bulacan Campus 
		<br><br>
		I have developed a keen interest in computers that started during my childhood. Back then, I 
		thoroughly enjoyed playing online games on the computer, which prompted me to explore the world 
		of computer hardware and software. I took the initiative to search for information and teach myself 
		how to build and troubleshoot computers. This experience became a turning point in my life, 
		leading me to make the decision to pursue a career in Information Technology. Consequently, 
		I opted to take the I.T. course in college with the ultimate goal of becoming a proficient and 
		professional IT officer.
		<br><br>
		My hobbies are singing, playing basketball, riding a motorcycle, <br>watching movies and sometimes play online games.
